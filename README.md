Description:

  I made this for Intro to Gamedev's second prototype project. I aimed to make a simple, fun, and quick mobile game that the user could pick up and put down easily. I think I achieved that goal, as all the reviews I got from friends and family were similar to that aim (without me letting them know what I was aiming for).

Influences:

  - the 'Pokio' bird capture from Super Mario Odyssey

Next Steps:

  - Polishing and fleshing out gameplay features
  - Working with an artist to develop a polished aesthetic
  - Publishing
