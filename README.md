# Overview Of Current Projects
A visual tour of the current projects I'm working on.

## Untitled Pokemon GO Clone
### Status: Super Early Prototype

### How to Play:

  Walking around gives the player storable encounters with pokemon, that when pressed allows the players to try and catch the pokemon to have in their inventory.

### Dev Description:

  This game plays similar to Pokemon GO, with several small but solid changes. One, instead of an overworld map, the player generates encounter cards by walking that are then stored for the play to use whenever. Two, pokemon are 2D sprites instead of 3D models. These changes make the game doable on a small scale and allow the user to try to catch their pokemon whenever, instead of having to have their phone out all the time while they're outside. That being said, encounters can be granted for anything, not just steps. It could be safe elevated heart rate tracked via fitbit integration, or days gone to the gym, or days sober, or days meeting their diet, etc.

### Influences:

  - Pokemon GO

### Next Steps:

  - develop sophisticated prototype and further planning

## Shape Escape
### Status: On Hold

### How to Play:

  The player controls a red ball in a 2D space. By dragging and releasing the ball, it launches in that direction. While launched, pressing down again makes the ball attempt to anchor to the wall, but only if an anchorable material is in front of the ball (in the gif, white parts are attachable). Different prefab wall peices are spawned and despawned as the player rises so that no two playthroughs are ever the same. Lava chases the player and speeds up over time, and if it catches the player it's game over.

### Dev Description:

  I made this for Intro to Gamedev's second prototype project. I aimed to make a simple, fun, and quick mobile game that the user could pick up and put down easily. I think I achieved that goal, as all the reviews I got from friends and family were similar to that aim (without me letting them know what my goal was).

### Influences:

  - the 'Pokio' bird capture from Super Mario Odyssey

### Next Steps:

  - Polishing and fleshing out gameplay features
  - Working with an artist to develop a polished aesthetic
  - Publishing


## Wemm Wrangler
### Status: On Hold

### How to Play:

  The player is given a set number of Wemms (nonsensically-titled little guys) per level, with the goal of getting one into the 'golden zone' to win the level and progress to the next. Dragging back on the right-most Wemm will launch it forward in a zero-gravity space environment, and if it exits the screen it is destroyed. Obstacles in the way include: planets and their gravity fields, teleporters, kill zones, etc. 

### Dev Description:

  My goal for this was to make a heartier mobile game. I tried to make it still quick and easy to stop and start, but at the same time have more meat than a game like Shape Escape.  I think the base is pretty solid, with the only problem being that the way I have gravity fields coded right now feels... not clunky but inexact? Wemms when shot through a gravity field feel random in their trajectory, which isn't satisfying. A potential solution is to project their movement via some kind of line render, but I don't know how to get the lines to simulate physics effects without absolutely tanking the performance of the game. Awkward situation!

### Influences:

  - Mario Galaxy for the gravity and space themes
  - Angry Birds (or the medieval flash game its based on) for the launching of wemms and limited tries and level layouts 
  
### Next Steps:
  - determine solution to trajectory aiming problem
  - flesh out gameplay
