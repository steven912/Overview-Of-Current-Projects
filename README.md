## Shape Escape
### Status: On Hold

### How to Play:

  The player controls a red ball in a 2D space. By dragging and releasing the ball, it launches in that direction. While launched, pressing down again makes the ball attempt to anchor to the wall, but only if an anchorable material is in front of the ball (in the gif, white parts are attachable). Different prefab wall peices are spawned and despawned as the player rises so that no two playthroughs are ever the same. Lava chases the player and speeds up over time, and if it catches the player it's game over.

### Dev Description:

  I made this for Intro to Gamedev's second prototype project. I aimed to make a simple, fun, and quick mobile game that the user could pick up and put down easily. I think I achieved that goal, as all the reviews I got from friends and family were similar to that aim (without me letting them know what my goal was).

### Influences:

  - the 'Pokio' bird capture from Super Mario Odyssey

### Next Steps:

  - Polishing and fleshing out gameplay features
  - Working with an artist to develop a polished aesthetic
  - Publishing


## Wemm Wrangler
### Status: On Hold

### How to Play:

  The player is given a set number of Wemms (nonsensically-titled little guys) per level, with the goal of getting one into the 'golden zone' to win the level and progress to the next. Dragging back on the right-most Wemm will launch it forward in a zero-gravity space environment, and if it exits the screen it is destroyed. Obstacles in the way include: planets and their gravity fields, teleporters, kill zones, etc. 

### Dev Description:

  My goal for this was to make a heartier mobile game. I tried to make it still quick and easy to stop and start, but at the same time have more meat than a game like Shape Escape.  I think the base is pretty solid, with the only problem being that the way I have gravity fields coded right now feels... not clunky but inexact? Wemms when shot through a gravity field feel random in their trajectory, which isn't satisfying. A potential solution is to project their movement via some kind of line render, but I don't know how to get the lines to simulate physics effects without absolutely tanking the performance of the game. Awkward situation!

### Influences:

  - Mario Galaxy for the gravity and space themes
  - Angry Birds (or the medieval flash game its based on) for the launching of wemms and limited tries and level layouts 
  
### Next Steps:
  - determine solution to trajectory aiming problem
  - flesh out gameplay
