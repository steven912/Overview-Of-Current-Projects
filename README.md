### How to Play:

  The player controls a red ball in a 2D space. By dragging and releasing the ball, it launches in that direction. While launched, pressing down again makes the ball attempt to anchor to the wall, but only if an anchorable material is in front of the ball (in the gif, white parts are attachable). Lava chases the player and speeds up over time, and if it catches the player it's game over.

### Dev Description:

  I made this for Intro to Gamedev's second prototype project. I aimed to make a simple, fun, and quick mobile game that the user could pick up and put down easily. I think I achieved that goal, as all the reviews I got from friends and family were similar to that aim (without me letting them know what my goal was).

### Influences:

  - the 'Pokio' bird capture from Super Mario Odyssey

### Next Steps:

  - Polishing and fleshing out gameplay features
  - Working with an artist to develop a polished aesthetic
  - Publishing
